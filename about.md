Since moving to New York City in 2005 via Montreal and Fargo, North Dakota, Aryeh Kobrinsky has quickly established himself as a creative and versatile bassist on the New York jazz scene. Aryeh stands at the vanguard of a generation of instrumental performers for whom the notion of genre is becoming increasingly ambiguous. He holds a BMus from McGill University and a MMus from New England Conservatory where he studied with Danilo Perez, George Garzone, Jerry Bergonzi and double bass luminary, Don Palma.

Having toured Europe, North Africa, Canada and the United States Aryeh has performed with a wide variety of artists including Tyshawn Sorey, Hal Crook, Andrew Dâ€™Angelo, Matt Wilson, Bob Moses and Dominique Eade. Currently he can often be heard with with John McNeil's Hush Point, The New Old Timers, Bob Moses, Perfect Friend and last but not least, his own quintet Brinsk. 

In 2015, Aryeh switched to tuning his bass in fifths, an octave below cello: C - G - D - A. The conversion to the new tuning was a major undertaking as he essentially had to unlearn and relearn the entire instrument. His solo project "Solo Shmolo" has been a gradual documentation of the process. Aryeh is currently finishing up his solo bass record which will be released in September 2018.
