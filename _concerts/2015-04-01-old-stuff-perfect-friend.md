On April Fools Day, A.E. Randolph is proud to present a great double bill of Old Stuff (playing music written by The New York Art Quartet) & Perfect Friend. 

9pm
This will be the first performance of Old Stuff, a recently configured unit which was started as a means to investigate the enigmatic and elusive music of a short-lived 1960s ensemble, The New York Art Quartet. The group will play music from both of the groupâ€™s officially sanctioned LPs as well as compositions from recently resurfaced concert recordings and bootlegs. Old Stuff is: Sam Weinberg - tenor saxophone; Ryan Snow - trombone; Kim Cass - bass; Max Goldman - drums

10:15pm
Perfect Friend is a new collaborative quartet comprised of some of Brooklyn's most imaginative improvisers: Jake Henry - trumpet; Nathaniel Morgan - alto saxophone; Aryeh Kobrinsky - bass ; Cody Brown -drums.
