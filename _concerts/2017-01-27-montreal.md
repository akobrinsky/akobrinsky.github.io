**Set I: Aryeh Kobrinsky - Solo Bass**    
Two years ago, Aryeh converted to tuning his bass in 5ths as opposed to the standard 4ths. This solo set is an exploration of the new sounds, timbres and harmonic possibilities that have developed out of the new tuning: doom-cello... avant-folk

**Set II: Heavenly Banquet**  
Gabriel Lambert - electric guitar  
Jace Lasek - electric guitar  
Heavenly Banquet was born through a musical encounter between Gabriel Lambert and Jace Lasek. While touring with the Besnard Lakes, and stuck in a particularly long sound check, the guitarists started improvising freely, creating abstract waves of sound, looking high in the sky. Maybe the sounds were influenced by the long drives in desolate New Mexico, or from listening to unreasonably long podcasts about UFOs playing in a loop. The duo is looking to express the deep religious world of Olivier Messiaen, with the sound treatment of the British shoegazers Slowdive.
