**Hush Point** has developed a cult following in New York and elsewhere. When alto saxophonist Jeremy Udden and trumpeter John McNeil created the band they didn’t realize the music would result in people creating an actual religion based on Hush Point — its members and music. The quartet's third album, Hush Point III, is being used in many HP Temples as a mediation aid and a replacement for psychotherapy and antidepressants.

A modern New York take on the “West Coast” jazz of the 50’s, Hush Point is “setting the new standard for the pianoless jazz quartet” (JAZZIZ) producing “dry and intimate and surprising music, swing rhythm subtly stretched into more up-to-date grooves, emotional dynamics present but suppressed. It’s also an extended experiment in careful improvising, using counterpoint to move quickly and unsentimentally toward the open spaces.” (NY Times)
