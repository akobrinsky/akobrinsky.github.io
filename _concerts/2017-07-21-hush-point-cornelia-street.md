Hush Point is a modern jazz quartet that uses improvised counterpoint created at a level rarely heard today.

The band’s third CD, “Hush Point III” was released in January and everything seemed to be going well. Then, in early March, Donald Trump inexplicably began a series of Twitter attacks against Hush Point and its music. It’s highly unlikely that the President has ever listened to any Hush Point CDs, so what provoked this assault is unclear.

The first tweets were relatively mild — “Hush Point? What’s the point? ” “Where’s the melody? ” — and didn’t really merit a response. Within a few weeks, however, the level of vitriol rose sharply: 

"Hush Point. Fake jazz. Sad and un-American,” 

"There [sic] tunes don’t have any words! Anybody can hear that!” 

“Hash Point: four boring losers going nowhere. Fans are tired of HP conterpunt [sic] fake jazz.”

These attacks continue, and call Hush Point’s music not only “fake jazz,” but “unpatriotic,” “divisive” and "elitist." 

It’s time to take a stand. Hush Point is sponsoring a rally at 9:00 p.m. on Friday, July 21st at the Cornelia Street Café in Manhattan’s West Village, and we urge jazz fans everywhere to attend. 

And then speak out! Go to live shows, buy Hush Point CDs — anything to tell Trump he can’t dictate what type of jazz is heard in America!!

A modern New York take on the “West Coast” jazz of the 50’s, Hush Point is “setting the new standard for the pianoless jazz quartet” (JAZZIZ) producing “dry and intimate and surprising music, swing rhythm subtly stretched into more up-to-date grooves, emotional dynamics present but suppressed. It’s also an extended experiment in careful improvising, using counterpoint to move quickly and unsentimentally toward the open spaces.” (NY Times)

“On it’s second superb album, this New York quartet continues to invoke it’s moniker… delving into deeply interactive improvisation that doesn’t need to shout to be heard.”  
**DOWNBEAT 4.5 Stars**

“The band focuses on subtle interplay and refined melodic improvisation, demonstrating an elegant rapport too often lacking in jazz today.”
