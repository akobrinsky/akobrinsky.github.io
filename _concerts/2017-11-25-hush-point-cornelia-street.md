**Hush Point** has developed a cult following in New York and elsewhere. When alto saxophonist Jeremy Udden and trumpeter John McNeil created the band they didn’t realize the music would result in people creating an actual religion based on Hush Point — its members and music. The quartet's third album, Hush Point III, is being used in many HP Temples as a mediation aid and a replacement for psychotherapy and antidepressants.

After caloric Thanksgiving debauchery, a set of contrapuntal jazz will cleanse your soul. Hush Point will conduct services featuring the laying on of instruments at 8:30 and 10:00.

A modern New York take on the “West Coast” jazz of the 50’s, Hush Point is “setting the new standard for the pianoless jazz quartet” (JAZZIZ) producing “dry and intimate and surprising music, swing rhythm subtly stretched into more up-to-date grooves, emotional dynamics present but suppressed. It’s also an extended experiment in careful improvising, using counterpoint to move quickly and unsentimentally toward the open spaces.” (NY Times)

“On it’s second superb album, this New York quartet continues to invoke it’s moniker… delving into deeply interactive improvisation that doesn’t need to shout to be heard.”  
**DOWNBEAT 4.5 Stars**

“The band focuses on subtle interplay and refined melodic improvisation, demonstrating an elegant rapport too often lacking in jazz today.”
