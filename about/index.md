## About Aryeh
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba...
Grew up in Fargo, North Dakota.

Since 2005, he has quickly established himself as a creative and versatile bassist on the New York jazz scene. Aryeh stands at the vanguard of a new generation of instrumental performers for whom the notion of genre is becoming increasingly ambiguous.

Having toured Europe, North Africa, Canada and the United States Aryeh has performed with a wide variety of artists including Tyshawn Sorey, Hal Crook, Andrew D'Angelo, Matt Wilson, Bob Moses and Dominique Eade.

Aryeh is a co-founder of Nowt Records, a not-for-profit cooperative independent label based in Brooklyn. Nowt released his debut album “A Hamster Speaks” in June, 2008. Aryeh can be seen performing regularly with projects/collaborations such as Dan Nettles Kenosha Kid; Pete Robbins Centric; Sara Serpa Quintet; Tony Falco's Internal Combustion Engine; Dominique Eade Quartet; his own quintet, BRINSK; and of course with Hush Point.
